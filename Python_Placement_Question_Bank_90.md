# Python Placement Question Bank

**90 Python coding questions for technical-round practice**

## Overview

| Level | Questions | Focus |
|---|---:|---|
| Basic | 50 | Core syntax, loops, lists, strings, dictionaries, simple functions |
| Intermediate | 30 | Problem solving, reusable logic, hashing, sliding-window ideas |
| Advanced | 10 | Algorithms, complexity, data structures, Python-specific concepts |

## How to Use This Sheet

1. Solve the **Basic** section first. Write code yourself before checking any solution.
2. For list/array problems, first use simple loops; then try to reduce time complexity.
3. For Bubble Sort practice, record both **comparisons** and **swaps** on paper for at least 3 test cases.
4. In technical rounds, explain your **approach, edge cases, and time/space complexity** after coding.

## Progress

| Level | Completed | Revised |
|---|---|---|
| Basic | ____ / 50 | ____ / 50 |
| Intermediate | ____ / 30 | ____ / 30 |
| Advanced | ____ / 10 | ____ / 10 |

## Topic Mix

| Section | Lists / Arrays | Strings | Dictionaries | Loops / Number Logic | Functions / Mixed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Basic | 13 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 7 |
| Intermediate | 7 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 6 |
| Advanced | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |

### Suggested Order

**1. Lists / Arrays → 2. Loops / Number Logic → 3. Strings → 4. Dictionaries → 5. Functions / Mixed**

Your target areas are covered heavily, and **Bubble Sort**, **comparison count**, **swap count**, **second-largest**, and **second-smallest** problems are included explicitly.

> **Interview habit:** After every solution, be ready to answer: *Why does it work? What happens for an empty list? What about duplicates? What is the time complexity?*

> **Practice rule:** Try without `sort()`, `sorted()`, `max()`, `min()`, or shortcuts first when the question specifically asks you not to use them.
